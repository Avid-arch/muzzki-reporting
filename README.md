# muzzki-reporting
Data cleaning and reporting automation project built in Python. Combines messy CSV exports, validates accuracy with tests, and generates Excel performance reports.
Good. Now we build this like someone who actually knows what they’re doing 😎



# Enterprise Data Validation & QA Reporting Tool

## Overview

This project simulates a real-world Quality Assurance workflow.

The objective is to:

* Ingest structured CSV data from multiple sources
* Validate data integrity and consistency
* Identify discrepancies
* Generate a structured Excel summary report

This project demonstrates analytical problem-solving, structured testing practices, and basic data automation using Python.

## Problem Statement

Organizations often receive data exports from multiple systems (inventory, performance reports, transaction logs, etc.).

These datasets may contain:

* Missing values
* Duplicate entries
* Inconsistent formats
* Mismatched records

Manual validation is time-consuming and error-prone.

This tool automates validation and reporting to improve accuracy and efficiency.

## Features

* CSV ingestion and parsing
* Duplicate detection
* Missing value detection
* Data type validation
* Summary statistics generation
* Excel output report

---

## Tech Stack

* Python
* CSV module / pandas (if you use it)
* openpyxl (if exporting Excel)

---

## How to Run

1. Clone repository
2. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Place input CSV files inside `/data` folder
4. Run:

   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```
5. Output report will generate in `/output` folder
